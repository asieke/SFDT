## Heading

Stop Daytrading before you start!

## Sub-Heading

What if a one minute game could save you a lifetime of financial stress?

## Summary

Studies have show time, and time and time again that it is not possible to beat the stock market. In other words no matter how much time you spend on /r/wallstreebets, CNBC, discord, twitter... the overwhelming odds are that you will not be able to outsmart the market.

You could spend hours these studies OR you could simply try your hand at this 1 minute game. This game will prove that you cannot reliably beat the stock market.

If you beat this game: congrats you've identified a trading strategy, go make your $millions!

If you cannot beat this game: congrats, you've learned with pretend money that you cannot beat the market, now go buy some index funds!

## Problem

In the Robinhood, crypto, meme stock era, it seems like there is a new discount brokerage hawking trading platforms that amount to little more than legalized casinos. Yet somehow these "tools" are positioned as financially responsible. We aim to fight this perception and teach a new generation of investors that they should run as fast as they can away from predatory day trading platforms.

## Solution

_This product is a teaching tool designed to help people stop day trading before they start._

We will use historical data on actively traded stocks from the last 5 years. Users will be able to trade these stocks in a simulated envinment with fake money. At the end of each simulated trading session the user will be able to see whether or not they "beat the market". They will also be able to see aggregate statistics on how often all users "beat the market".

By learning through doing, users shall see the folly of day trading and save themselves headache and financial stress down the road.
